Experimenting with linear regression machine learning models that attempt to predict movie ratings

# Introduction

This repository contains the scripts and report required for the final module of [Professional Certificate in Data Science learning programme by HarvardX](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science)

The final Course Capstone (PH125.9x) requires the student to apply linear regression machine learning technique to study the different effects on the prediction model's accuracy. 
The student will have to use the MovieLens data set specified in the assingment instructions. 

The ability to clearly communicate the process and insights gained from an analysis is an important skill for data scientists.

# Summary of file contents
* The R script file contains codes used for data exploration, visualisation and building the prediction models
* The Rmd file contains codes to generate the PDF report that describes the process and outcome of the development of models that predict movie ratings
* The PDF report describing data analysis, findings and conclusion
